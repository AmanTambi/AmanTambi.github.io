Work experience
======
* **Robotics Engineer**: January 2025 - June 2025
  *Addverb ([Website](https://addverb.com/)) ([Certificate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qC_RvgIGLoX2rI3WXnGblO0ZrSSlI8qT/view?usp=sharing))* \
  * Collaborated on development, implementation, and testing of model predictive control utilizing centroidal dynamics, resulting in stable quadruped locomotion at 0.5-1.0 m/sec on flat terrain.
  * Utilized Isaac Lab to simulate robotic environments and train deep reinforcement learning policies (PPO) using PyTorch, performing sim-to-real transfers of learned controls onto physical Trakr quadruped.
  * Represented Addverb to demonstrate Trakr quadruped to the Prime Minister of India.
* **Project Scientist**: June 2023 - December 2024 \
  *Indian Institute of Technology Delhi ([IITD](https://home.iitd.ac.in/)) ([Certificate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D7KyRy5DfKVSuAEqu4P1nphSkaz6tRBW/view?usp=sharing))* \
  * Developed a Robot Operating System (ROS) based autonomy stack combining visual/audio perception with task and motion planning; demonstrated zero-shot task completion in unseen assistive settings on Franka Emika Panda and Hello robot Stretch.
  * Conceptualized G2TR, a factored pipeline for grounded temporal reasoning (event localization → spatial grounding → semantic tracking), achieving 70.1% grounding accuracy (+26% vs. baselines) on 155 video–instruction pairs.
  * Built an open set, zero-shot and dynamically updatable scene-graph generation pipeline using foundation models with focused attention – F1=0.95(+0.16 v/s best baseline), stronger relation extraction and aided long horizon planning.
  * Enhanced 3D model creation by fusing masks from visual language models + monocular-depth priors with multi-view point clouds. Demonstrated collision-free sequential manipulation in unstructured scenes with UR5 on a Husky base.
* **Robotics Intern** : January 2023 - May 2023 \
  *Miko Robotics ([Website](https://miko.ai/)) ([Certificate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z4ErwxGGWl-2z48mFWVm7T7Z8pN56lpo/view?usp=sharing))* \
  * Contributed to design and development of [Miko-mini](https://in.miko.ai/products/miko-mini), a 3-wheeled mobile companion robot for children.
  * Performed Euler–Lagrange dynamic analysis of elliptical-trammel wheel-lift in a 4-wheeled robot; found installed motor was 30% under-torqued, informing re-spec.
  * Established that plastic-geared DC motors meet performance targets at lower cost vs. metal-geared alternatives through speed–torque, durability, acoustic, and thermal tests.

* **Summer Intern** : June 2022 - September 2022 \
  *Systemantics ([Website](https://www.systemantics.com/)) ([Certificate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tYhD3VrARtKhDT0Zj93x6aU9XngOiwfe/view?usp=sharing))* \
  * Validated sensorless momentum-observer based kinesthetic teaching on J1–J3 of a 6-DOF manipulator, enabling compliant cartesian motion without a force/torque sensor.
  * Designed and modeled a 3-finger cam-synchronized parallel gripper in Fusion 360; 2.5 kg rated payload.
  * Configured an existing custom robotic arm into the MoveIt pipeline, integrating ros_control for hardware communication, setting up kinematics and collision checking, and enabling full trajectory planning and execution.

* **Robotics Intern** : April 2021 - July 2021 \
  *iFuture Robotics ([Website](http://www.ifuturerobotics.com)) ([Certificate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_PS4g3ntIny5cyYhUBOQvo2CKLoGZjle/view?usp=sharing))* \
  * Developed kinematics and dynamics models for a 5-bar parallel axis robotic arm, enabling precise control and positioning.
  * Conducted a workspace analysis for a parallel arm robot prone to singularities, aiming to improve its operational range and reliability.
  * Performed motor sizing analysis for the robotic arm using VREP/CoppeliaSim simulation data.
