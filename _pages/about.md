I am a graduate student at the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). I am interested at building embodied AI systems that push the boundaries of humanâ€“robot collaboration.

Previously, I worked as a research associate at Indian Institute of Technology Delhi under the guidance of [Prof. Rohan Paul](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~rohanpaul/) and [Prof. P.V.M Rao](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~pvmrao/). My research included fascinating field of leveraging foundation models for embodied AI agents. I developed methods for open-world perception and planning, specifically for field and assistive robots, using foundational models. Additionally, I worked on the challenge of grounded temporal reasoning and space grounding by combining foundation models with graph neural networks. I was also involved in developing the autonomy stack for assistive robotics, which integrated all my previous research efforts to robustly execute language-instructed tasks.

During my undergrad, I interned at several companies, including [Systemantics](https://www.systemantics.com/), [Miko Robotics](https://miko.ai/), [iFuture Robotics](http://www.ifuturerobotics.com), and [Bajaj Auto](https://www.bajajauto.com/). These experiences allowed me to deepen my understanding of robot kinematics and dynamics, control systems design for both manipulators and mobile robots, work with the Robot Operating System (ROS), and develop proficiency in CAD modeling.

Before pursuing engineering, I was an Air Force cadet at the prestigious National Defence Academy ([NDA](https://nda.nic.in/)) in Pune, having secured an All India Rank (AIR) of 7 in the entrance exam. Unfortunately, I had to leave NDA due to an injury incured during training.
 
Beyond research, I find joy in table tennis, volleyball and spending time outdoors.
