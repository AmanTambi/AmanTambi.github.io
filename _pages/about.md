I am working as a Project Scientist under the mentorship of 
[Prof. Rohan Paul](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~rohanpaul/) and 
[Prof. P.V.M Rao](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~pvmrao/) at the Indian Institute of 
Techonology Delhi ([IITD](https://home.iitd.ac.in/)). I did my undergraduate studies 
from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani ([BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/)). 

My research interests lie in the fascinating field of leveraging foundation models for embodied AI agents. I have developed methods for open-world perception and planning, specifically for field and assistive robots, using foundational models. Additionally, I have worked on the challenge of grounded temporal reasoning and am currently exploring space grounding by combining foundation models with graph neural networks. I am also involved in developing the autonomy stack for assistive robotics, which integrates all my previous research efforts to robustly execute language-instructed tasks. 

During college, I interned at several companies, including [Systemantics](https://www.systemantics.com/), [Miko Robotics](https://miko.ai/), [iFuture Robotics](http://www.ifuturerobotics.com), and [Bajaj Auto](https://www.bajajauto.com/). These experiences allowed me to deepen my understanding of robot kinematics and dynamics, control systems design for both manipulators and mobile robots, work with the Robot Operating System (ROS), and develop proficiency in CAD modeling.

Before pursuing engineering, I was an Air Force cadet at the prestigious National Defence Academy ([NDA](https://nda.nic.in/)) in Pune, having secured an All India Rank (AIR) of 7 in the entrance exam. Unfortunately, I had to leave NDA due to an injury incured during training.
